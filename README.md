Hunk is a desktop-inspired terminal diff viewer for reviewing agent-authored changesets.

- AI annotations
- full-screen multi-file review stream
- keyboard & mouse support
- split, stacked, and responsive auto layouts
- Git pager and difftool integration

## Install

```bash
npm i -g hunkdiff
```

Requirements:

- Node.js 18+
- Currently supported on macOS and Linux
- Git is recommended for most workflows

## Usage

### Basics

```bash
hunk           # show help
hunk --version # get version
```

### Working with Git

```bash
hunk diff         # review current repo changes
hunk diff --staged
hunk show         # review the latest commit
hunk show HEAD~1  # review an earlier commit
```

### Working with raw files/patches

```bash
hunk diff before.ts after.ts        # compare two files directly
git diff --no-color | hunk patch -  # review a patch from stdin
```

## Git integration

You can set Hunk as your Git pager so `git diff` and `git show` open in Hunk automatically.

From the terminal:

```bash
git config --global core.pager "hunk pager"
```

Or in your Git config:

```ini
[core]
    pager = hunk pager
```

If you’d rather keep Git’s default `diff` and `show` behavior, you can add optional aliases instead:

```bash
git config --global alias.hdiff "-c core.pager=\"hunk pager\" diff"
git config --global alias.hshow "-c core.pager=\"hunk pager\" show"
```

## Examples

Ready-to-run demo diffs live in [`examples/`](examples/README.md).

Each example includes the exact command to run from the repository root.

## Pi integration

Hunk ships a bundled Pi skill named `hunk-review`.

Use it from a local checkout:

```bash
pi install /path/to/hunk
# or rely on Pi's project/package discovery while working inside the repo
```

Or install it from the published package:

```bash
pi install npm:hunkdiff
```

Then load it in Pi with:

```bash
/skill:hunk-review
```

The skill explains what Hunk is and how to use `hunk session ...` for live code review.

## Config

Hunk reads config from:

- `~/.config/hunk/config.toml`
- `.hunk/config.toml`

Example:

```toml
theme = "midnight" # midnight, graphite, paper, ember
mode = "auto"      # auto, split, stack
line_numbers = true
wrap_lines = false
agent_notes = false
```

## Advanced workflows

- `hunk diff --agent-context <file>` loads inline agent rationale from a JSON sidecar
- `hunk mcp serve` runs the local Hunk session daemon and websocket broker
  - normal Hunk sessions auto-start/register with it when MCP is enabled
  - Hunk keeps the daemon loopback-only by default
  - if you intentionally need remote access, set `HUNK_MCP_UNSAFE_ALLOW_REMOTE=1` and choose a non-loopback `HUNK_MCP_HOST`

### Live session control CLI

`hunk session ...` is the user-facing and agent-facing interface to Hunk's local live review session daemon.

Use explicit session targeting with either a live `<session-id>` or `--repo <path>` when exactly one live session matches that repo root.

```bash
hunk session list
hunk session context --repo .
hunk session navigate --repo . --file README.md --hunk 2
hunk session comment add --repo . --file README.md --new-line 103 --summary "Frame this as MCP-first"
hunk session comment list --repo .
hunk session comment rm --repo . mcp:1234
hunk session comment clear --repo . --file README.md --yes
```

The session CLI works against live session comments only. It does not edit `.hunk/latest.json`.

## Performance notes

Hunk spends more startup time than plain diff output tools because it launches an interactive UI with syntax highlighting, navigation state, and optional agent context. In exchange, it is optimized for reviewing a full changeset instead of printing static diff text and exiting.
